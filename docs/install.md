Assemble requires Grunt `~0.4.1` or higher.

_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install Assemble with the following command:

```bash
npm install {%= name %} --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('{%= name %}');
```
